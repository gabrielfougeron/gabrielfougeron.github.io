description:
abstract: 'This paper presents the Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) of a business jet including static aeroelastic effects. Two different CFD tools (AETHER by Dassault Aviation and PUMA by NTUA) are coupled with a CSM model (VPS software by ESI). Single discipline as well as coupled multi-disciplinary sensitivity derivatives (SDs) are computed by means of adjoint methods. Both a purely discrete and a hybrid continuous(fluid)/discrete(structure) adjoint formulations are presented. The computed SDs are verified against finite differences.'
