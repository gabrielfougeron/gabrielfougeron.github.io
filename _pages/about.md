Hi, My name is Gabriel Fougeron and I'm a numerical analysis expert. I use computers to explore the world and better understand its subtleties.
Striving for a better understanding of the physical world requires a wide range of skills. This is how I developed competencies in fields including numerical linear algebra, optimization, differential geometry, simulation of partial and ordinary differential equations, machine learning, scientific programming ...

For the past 10 years at [ESI Group](https://www.esi-group.com/), I've been designing, prototyping and testing novel numerical methods for better and faster predictive physics for our customers.
There, I spent my PhD developing a theoretical framework for the meshless simulation of partial differential equations, bridging the gap between traditional mesh-based and meshless methods.
I then moved on to large-scale multi-disciplinary adjoint optimization with applications to design in aeronautics.
For the past two years, I've been leveraging hardware acceleration techniques to enable fast optimal transport capabilities in our in-house reduced-order modelling software.

I've also invested unreasonable amounts of time in small pet projects across the years. The latest of them is an open-source python library for the computation of periodic N-body gravitational orbits. You can experiment with the web-app demo at [this address](https://gabrielfougeron.github.io/choreo/), no installation required!
